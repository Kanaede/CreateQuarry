A mod that provides a variety of strange objects, most of which are natural products that can be taken directly.

Create Quarry requires the Create mod to process materials and some other functions.

Create Quarry also has item tags if you want to make items from other mods, or make items with special materials from Create Quarry.

Source project for the Create mod, well I made it just following the suggestions,
so I don't really know my own program - lol

I don't plan to create a big project with a capable discord moderator, seeing as I don't have anything to give.

You can help me create a wiki or participate in creating mods, but I don't have the capital to develop mods for a fee.
